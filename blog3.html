    </div>

   <p>Homemade makeup wipes are an easy solution to clean your face at the end of a tiring day. Given that they’re made from all natural ingredients, they’re so much healthier for your skin than the wipes you typically buy at retail stores, and not to mention a lot cheaper! I’ve been using those homemade wipes for a month now and believe it or not, they’ve been the best makeup remover I’ve used to date. My skin feels so great and vibrant because of all the added benefits that come from its ingredients.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients and measurements:</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>1 Mason Jar (I used a 16 oz one)</li>
      <li>1 Tablespoon alcohol-free witch hazel</li>
      <li>2 Tablespoons coconut oil</li>
      <li>½ cup distilled water</li>
      <li>2 drops lavender essential oil</li>
      <li>2 drops tea tree essential oil</li>
    </ul> 

    <p>To create your wipes, all you need to do is mix all the ingredients together put the mixture and the cotton pads inside the jar.  After you’re done, make sure all the cotton pads have absorbed your mix and close the jar so they wipes don’t dry out. </p>

    <h2>Alcohol-free witch hazel: </h2>
    <p>witch hazel is often used as a natural skin remedy because of its wide range of benefits. It’s anti-inflammatory and antioxidant which helps soothe irritated skin. It also fights bacteria, reduces under-eye puffiness, and cleans and tightens your pores which prevents acne-causing bacteria from entering.  Make sure to use alcohol-free witch hazel to prevent your skin from drying out or becoming irritated.</p>

    <h2>Coconut oil:</h2>
    <p>Coconut oil can really help keep your skin moisturized and it’s great for breaking down makeup.</p>

    <h2>Distilled water:</h2>
    <p>I recommend you use distilled water over regular water because it doesn’t contain any substances or bacteria meaning it will increase the quality and lifespan of your wipes. </p>

    <h2>Lavender and Tea tree essential oil:</h2>
    <p>Essential oils add a great scent to your wipes that makes them very refreshing. They also have some great benefits to your skin; for example, Lavender essential oil detoxifies and moisturizes your skin and prevents wrinkles,  and tea tree essential oil has antibacterial properties that can help preserve the wipes a little longer. </p>

    <p>I recommend you make a batch that will last you only a week or two because a common problem other people have reported with homemade makeup remover wipes is growing mold after a period of time. However, a few ways you can delay the moldiness is by using tea tree essential oil, distilled water over regular water, and putting your wipes in the fridge.</p>

    <p>To sum everything up, not only did those wipes improve my skin a lot, but they’re also better than any other makeup remover wipes I’ve ever used, and way cheaper! I don’t think I can ever go back from using them.</p>
