    <h1>About the blog</h1>
    <p> Hello there! Welcome to my blog. My attempt here is to make this blog a reflection of my complex, creative personality. The best way to put it, I’m a life explorer. Those closest to me know that I cannot settle for simply one thing. I do not have one skillset or specialty that I excel at and live for, but I have set of diverse ideas that I feel very passionate about. </p>

    <p>Even though it took me a while to realize that I don’t have a one true calling, I eventually learned to appreciate and embrace my multi-personality. Some of my passions include traveling to explore different cultures and architecture, creating different forms of art, inspiring people to live a fulfilling life, fighting for women’s equality, following an entrepreneurial journey, constantly learning about the world around me, and honestly many many more. </p>

    <p>I always come up with crazy ideas that I could explore, so I decided to make it my life’s mission to try out everything I find slightly interesting. If you are a multi-personality like myself, or curious to see what it’s like, join me in my constantly evolving journey of personal exploration. </p>
